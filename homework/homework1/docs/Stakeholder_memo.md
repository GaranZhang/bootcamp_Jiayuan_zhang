# MetaTrader Performance Optimization

## Project Scoping
MetaTrader (MT4/MT5) users frequently face performance issues such as order execution delays, unstable connections, and data synchronization lags, which can lead to missed opportunities and financial losses. This project aims to scope, analyze, and address these bottlenecks by collecting trade logs and network metrics, identifying high-risk periods, and delivering monitoring dashboards, latency alerts, and optimization recommendations for brokers and traders.
