# MetaTrader Performance Optimization
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
MetaTrader (MT4/MT5) is one of the most widely used trading platforms for Forex and CFD markets, yet traders frequently experience performance issues such as order execution delays, unstable connections, and data synchronization lags. These problems can lead to missed trading opportunities, higher transaction costs, and reduced profitability. This project aims to identify, quantify, and mitigate these performance bottlenecks to improve trading reliability and efficiency.

## Stakeholder & User
Primary users include retail and institutional traders who depend on low-latency, stable platforms for effective trading. Key stakeholders are brokers, technical support teams, and algorithmic trading developers. Decision-making primarily rests with brokers and technical leads who can implement infrastructure and network optimizations.

## Useful Answer & Decision
The project will produce descriptive analyses to identify when and where latency is most severe, and predictive insights to anticipate high-risk periods. Deliverables will include performance monitoring dashboards, latency alert systems, and optimization recommendations for server and network configurations.


## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Exact peak latency periods are unknown.
- Network conditions may vary unpredictably.
- Broker server performance differs by location.
